    Generate a road profile using a clothoid-like approximation.

    A clothoid (Euler spiral) is a curve whose curvature increases linearly
    with its arc length. We'll approximate this with a polynomial curve.

    -----------
    num_points : int
        Number of points to generate
    x_max : float
        Maximum x-coordinate value

    Returns:

    tuple of (np.array, np.array)
